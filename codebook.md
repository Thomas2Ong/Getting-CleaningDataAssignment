# Getting-CleaningDataAssignment

Modifications

This assignment modified the dataset in publications by Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

The following are the modications:
1. Merging 30 subjects' training and testing data into one dataset.
2. Extracting the average (mean) and standard deviation (std) measurements.
3. Using "features.txt" to rename the column names of X dataset from serial (V1 to V561) to descriptive (eg. tBodyAcc-mean()-X) as in Measurements section below.
4. Using "activity_labels.txt" to rename the column data of Y dataset from numeric (1 to 6) to descriptive (WALKING, WALKING-UPSTAIRS, WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
5. Create a tidy dataset with the average of variable of each subject's activity.


Measurements

The following measurements are used in this project. From the original raw data, only average (mean) and standard deviation (std) are extracted.
